## Features

- **Modified RSA Encryption**: We employ a customized RSA algorithm that uses three numbers to encrypt your voice data, providing exceptional security.
- **Voice Data Capture**: Your voice data is captured through a microphone using the Google Speech API.
- **Hashing and Salting**: We employ robust hashing and salting techniques to protect your voice data from unauthorized access.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Ultra-Secure-Voice-Encryption.git`
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python, libraries, or any specific requirements).
3. Run the application by following the instructions in the [Usage](#usage) section.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Speak into your microphone, and the Google Speech API will capture your voice data.
3. The voice data will be securely encrypted using our modified RSA algorithm.
4. Encrypted data will be hashed and salted for added security.
5. You can now store or transmit your voice data with confidence, knowing it's protected.

## Encryption Details

Our modified RSA encryption uses a unique combination of three numbers to create a highly secure encryption key. Additionally, your voice data undergoes a rigorous hashing and salting process to ensure the utmost security.

## Use Case

**Engage your users with a compelling use case:**

Imagine a scenario where you need to securely store sensitive voice recordings, such as confidential meetings or personal notes. Our Ultra-Secure Voice Data Encryption system ensures that your voice data remains confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. Whether you're a journalist protecting your sources or a professional safeguarding your business discussions, this project provides a solution that combines cutting-edge encryption techniques with the ease of voice capture.

Some key use cases:

- **Journalism**: Protect your sources and confidential interviews with a state-of-the-art encryption system.
- **Business Meetings**: Safeguard your business discussions and intellectual property.
- **Personal Privacy**: Keep your personal voice notes and sensitive conversations secure from prying eyes.
- **Legal and Healthcare**: Securely store legal and healthcare voice records.

With Ultra-Secure Voice Data Encryption, your voice data remains yours and yours alone.
